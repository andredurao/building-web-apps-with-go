# Example 10 - Controllers

## Controllers

On this example I've could apply most of the functions I've learned on the examples
From example 6 I've learned how to render templates and used here to render the home and error templates.
From example 3 I've learned how to add new paths and how to execute different funcions on each path. With that I've set a few actions and render different content on each.
