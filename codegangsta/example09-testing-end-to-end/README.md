# Example 9 - Testing

## HTTP test - end to end

On this example the test checks if the middleware acted like expected.
After adding a "chain" of functions the `Hello World` text was rendered around another request function.

That may be used to build a simple framework and render partials around the template or execute database queries on other source files.
