# building-web-apps-with-go
Building web apps with go.

Initially this repository was created to implement the examples of codgangsta's book: "Building web apps with go".

Now I think I'll change this repository to create a collection of examples and implementations from books and tutorials.

This is my to create a `golang` reference so I can use on my other activities.
